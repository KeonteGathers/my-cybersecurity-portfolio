## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 1. **Incident Response: Suspicious Login / Brute-Force Investigation**  
Investigated repeated failed login attempts followed by a suspicious successful login. Analyzed authentication logs in Splunk, identified malicious IP activity, and executed containment actions.  
➡️ **[View Project](incident-response.md)**

### 2. **Network Traffic Analysis: HTTP/HTTPS Investigation**  
Performed deep packet inspection in Wireshark to analyze abnormal HTTPS traffic suspected of C2 communication. Identified malicious domains, analyzed HTTP headers, and recommended remediation.  
➡️ **[View Project](network-traffic-analysis.md)**

### 3. **Python Security Automation: File Integrity Monitoring Tool**  
Developed a Python-based security script to detect file modifications using SHA-256 hashes, automate integrity checks, and generate security audit logs.  
➡️ **[View Project](python-security-automation.md)**

### 4. **Security Audit & Risk Assessment: NIST-Based Controls**  
Completed a full internal audit using a Controls & Compliance Checklist and PASTA-based threat insights. Identified high-risk gaps, evaluated controls, and delivered a prioritized remediation plan.  
➡️ **[View Project](security-audit-risk-assessment.md)**

### 5. **Digital Forensics: Suspicious USB Device Investigation**  
Performed a forensic investigation into suspected data theft. Analyzed registry artifacts, USB device history, event logs, timestamps, and file access patterns to determine likelihood of exfiltration.  
➡️ **[View Project](digital-forensics-usb-investigation.md)**

### 6. **Threat Modeling: Web Application Using PASTA Framework**  
Created a full threat model of a web application using PASTA methodology. Built DFDs, attack trees, risks, controls, and mitigation strategies.  
➡️ **[View Project](threat-modeling-pasta.md)**
