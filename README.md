## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity analyst focused on incident response, threat analysis, network security, and risk-based decision making. I built this portfolio to demonstrate my hands-on skills in log analysis, digital forensics, automation, and security auditing. I am currently completing my cybersecurity certificate and actively pursuing entry-to-mid level cybersecurity roles.

## 🛠 Skills & Tools

**Security Tools:** Splunk, Wireshark, Suricata, Zeek, Security Onion, CyberChef  
**Forensics:** Windows Event Logs, Registry Analysis (USBSTOR), MAC Times  
**Programming:** Python, Bash

**Frameworks:** NIST CSF, NIST 800-53, MITRE ATT&CK  
**Other:** GitHub, Google Workspace, Ticketing systems (ServiceNow)

## 🔥 Featured Case Studies

### 1️⃣ Incident Response: Suspicious Login / Brute-Force Investigation  
Investigated repeated failed login attempts followed by a suspicious successful login. Used Splunk to analyze authentication logs, performed IP reputation checks, validated user identity, and recommended containment actions including password reset, session termination, and IP blocking.  
➡️ **[Read the case study](incident-response.md)**

---

### 2️⃣ Network Traffic Analysis: HTTP/HTTPS C2 Investigation  
Performed Wireshark deep packet analysis on abnormal HTTPS traffic suspected of command-and-control (C2) activity. Identified beaconing patterns, suspicious TLS handshakes, and malicious domains, then recommended host isolation and domain blocking.  
➡️ **[Read the case study](network-traffic-analysis.md)**

---

### 3️⃣ Python Security Automation: File Integrity Monitoring Tool  
Built a Python-based file integrity monitoring (FIM) script using SHA-256 hashing to detect unauthorized file changes. Implemented baseline hash generation, change detection, and simple logging for security auditing and incident response.  
➡️ **[View the project](python-security-automation.md)**

---

### 4️⃣ Security Audit & NIST-Based Risk Assessment  
Performed a structured security audit using NIST CSF / NIST 800-53, a controls & compliance checklist, and risk matrix. Identified high-risk gaps (no MFA, weak logging, USB control issues), then produced a prioritized remediation roadmap.  
➡️ **[Read the assessment](security-audit-risk-assessment.md)**

---

### 5️⃣ Digital Forensics: Suspicious USB Device Investigation  
Analyzed Windows registry artifacts (USBSTOR), event logs, and NTFS timestamps to investigate suspected data exfiltration via an unauthorized USB device. Built a forensic timeline that strongly indicated insider-driven data transfer.  
➡️ **[Read the investigation](digital-forensics-usb-investigation.md)**

---

### 6️⃣ Threat Modeling: Web Application (PASTA Framework)  
Applied the PASTA threat modeling framework to a web application handling sensitive user data. Created data flow diagrams, attack trees, and a risk matrix to identify and prioritize threats such as SQL injection, session hijacking, and IDOR.
